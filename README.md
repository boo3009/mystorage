# "My Storage", location-based warehousing (in development)

Simple application for location-based warehousing. It means, that you can store<br>
your goods in cells with numbers.<br>
- At first you'll be asked for inputs to generate cell numbers that fits your needs,<br>
in format "A-01-01", where 'A' is section, middle '01' is level, and last '01' is a<br>
right offset of cell on that level. Fex. 5th level of section B with offset 15 means<br>
"B-05-15". The rest of the necessary tables will be created for you.<br>
- Then you can add items, incomes, outcomes and get the balance. Items can be<br>
filtered for convinient searching. Balance can be written to file (print.txt) for further<br>
printing.

As simple as it can be. Thats all for now, enjoy :)<br>
